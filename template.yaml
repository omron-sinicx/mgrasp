overview: >
  Food picking is trivial for humans but not for robots, as foods are fragile. 
  Presetting foods' physical properties does not help robots much due to the objects' inter- and intra- category diversity. 
  In a previous study, we demonstrated that learning food properties is essential for fracture-free picking. 
  We leveraged the breaking experiences of food objects to obtain food properties. 
  During the training, a robot equipped with a universal two-finger gripper and tactile sensors broke the objects and measured the tactile signals, which describe when the fractures occur. 
  We then trained a fracture anticipation network, which anticipates the timing of the object's future fracture. 
  Fracture anticipation enables fracture-free picking by stopping the gripper motion immediately before the object breaks. 
  The previous method clarified that we could achieve food picking through object-breaking experiences; however, the method assumes a category-specific model and requires breaking many food objects in the category to train the model. 
  For practical use, the network should be able to anticipate the fracture of unseen food objects. 
  Furthermore, the amount of food consumption required for training is economically and environmentally undesirable.
  In this paper, we propose a method for making a robot grasp multiple unseen food categories without using a category-specific model trained by consuming a considerable amount of food in that category.
  The key idea is to leverage the object-breaking experiences of several reusable fragile objects instead of consuming real foods while making the picking ability
  object-invariant with domain generalization (DG). 
  In real-robot experiments, we trained a model with reusable objects (toy blocks, ping-pong balls, and jellies), selected based on the three common fracture types (crack, rupture, and crush). 
  We then tested the model with four real food objects (tofu, bananas, potato chips, and tomatoes). 
  The results showed that the proposed combination of reusable objects' breaking experiences and DG is effective for the food-picking task.

  #     The motors located at the base link drive the joints via cables. 
  #     This drawing shows the bottom side cables.
  #     The arm does not have any pretension mechanism between the motors and the termination location in moving links.

  #     This mechanism compact adds pretension to a cable by reeling this and fixes the cable to a link by inserting a pin.

  #     Joint parts cover pulleys to avoid cable-coming-off. 
  #     If a cable is slacked once, this cable can go back to a pulley by being covered.
